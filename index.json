In this configuration, a seismic gap and additional rigid diaphragm are no longer necessary, and excavation and foundation work may potentially be avoided in retrofit applications; however, columns under the isolation layer may not provide rigid boundary conditions, resulting in bearing end plates not remaining parallel. To investigate the effects of flexible columns in a column-top isolation system with elastomeric bearings, quasi-static cyclic testing of bearing-column subassemblies were conducted. Findings show that flexible end conditions can significantly reduce the lateral stiffness of elastomeric bearings. A simple analytical stiffness matrix is derived for bearings consisting of translational and rotational degrees of freedom at both end plates and is compared against experimental results. The simple model compares well for initial behavior but diverges from experimental results with larger end-plate rotations; however, when calibrated nonlinear material properties are included, the model performs well at capturing the behavior of elastomeric bearings when subjected to partially restrained boundary conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Experimental Investigation of Elastomeric Isolation Bearings with Flexible Supporting Columns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Crowder","Tracy Becker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483981439,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483981439,"objectID":"9a7106e1a837d23b20d7c230a74a0f4b","permalink":"https://AdrianCrowder.github.io/publication/16wcee/","publishdate":"2017-01-09T09:03:59-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/16wcee/","section":"publication","summary":"As seismic isolation continues to gain popularity for its ability to significantly reduce earthquake damage, retrofit applications are still limited due to significant construction expenses. Foundation work and excavation of a seismic gap, as well as installation of an additional rigid diaphragm lead to high project costs which often limit isolation retrofit to historical buildings. To mitigate these expenses, some designers have begun installing the isolation layer on the tops of the first level columns without the use of an additional rigid diaphragm. This type of installation also negates the need for excavation; however, designers typically design practically rigid support columns in an effort to limit any flexibility below the isolation plane. While this is practical for new construction, this may not be feasible for a retrofit application. This study considers the behavior of a column-top isolation system when subjected to varying substructure flexibilities. Large flexibility leads to end rotations in the isolation bearings during ground motions. To investigate this behavior, experimental cyclic testing of a column-bearing subsystem was done at McMaster University. The results are investigated and compared against a bearing model which accounts for changes in lateral stiffness and buckling behavior under both translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which was implemented in OpenSees. Experimental results show that flexible substructures can significantly reduce the lateral stiffness of elastomeric bearings and the end conditions must be accounted for to reasonably estimate the isolation period.","tags":[],"title":"Increased Substructure Flexibility on Column-Top Isolation Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research Topic Seismic isolation is a method of designing buildings to better withstand earthquakes. The method involves constructing a building on top of many bearings which separate the building from the ground. During an earthquake, these devices prevent violent accelerations from being passed into the building. This in turn prevents damage to the building and the contents inside.\nNumerous existing buildings have been upgraded with seismic isolation, but the process is often very expensive because of major alterations required at the base of the structure. The focus of my research was to make upgrades with seismic isolation more cost effective by placing the bearings on the tops of columns. This non-traditional placement can mitigate many of the costs traditionally associated with upgrades, but the interaction between the bearing and the column is not well understood. Experimental tests of a bearing connected to a column were performed, and a model was developed to predict the behaviour of the system. The research furthers the understanding of the field and will help designers create more cost effective solutions.\nExperimental Work Experimental testing of 4 subassemblies of a column and bearing were conducted at McMaster University. The test rig was designed and constructed to provide the necessary loads and displacements to the subassembies for testing.\nA video of one of the tests with a yielding column can be viewed below.\n","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"a5dae0f5cb4e2a588e900475feff38e3","permalink":"https://AdrianCrowder.github.io/project/thesis-topic/","publishdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/thesis-topic/","section":"project","summary":"A brief overview of my thesis topic and experimental work.","tags":["Research","Isolation"],"title":"Thesis Topic: Low Cost Seismic Isolation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Adrian Crowder","Tracy Becker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1464800639,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464800639,"objectID":"211edf159bd5f9dba7da5d963d7d99ed","permalink":"https://AdrianCrowder.github.io/publication/16csce/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T09:03:59-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/16csce/","section":"publication","summary":"Seismic isolation delivers improved performance by means of a flexible layer at which lateral deformation is concentrated. However, for seismic retrofit applications base isolation systems can be of considerable expense, in significant part because of major alterations required at the base of the structure. The cost of introducing an additional diaphragm, constructing a seismic gap, and modifying the foundation causes the initial cost of isolation to be significantly higher than traditional non-isolation retrofit methods. To minimize initial costs, isolators may be placed directly at the top of the column level, without an additional diaphragm, instead of at the base of the building. To investigate the effects of this placement and the limits of applicability, experiments were conducted at McMaster University of a column-bearing subassembly. These experiments tested bearings on increasing flexible steel columns, investigating the effect of allowing end rotations on the bearing behaviour and the effect of large displacements on the overall stability of the beam-column system. This research looks at developing clear strength and stiffness requirements for the sub-isolation system with the aim of increasing the number of existing buildings that are candidates for retrofit with isolation.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of Non-Traditional Isolation Placement for Seismic Retrofit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Crowder","Tracy Becker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1437498239,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437498239,"objectID":"df798212e9cfd1aeefaaee6f29c31ace","permalink":"https://AdrianCrowder.github.io/publication/11ccee/","publishdate":"2015-07-21T09:03:59-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/11ccee/","section":"publication","summary":"Seismic isolation offers considerable improvement to earthquake resistance by means of a flexible layer between the ground and building. However, base isolation systems can add considerable expense to projects, especially for seismic retrofit applications. This is because significant funds must go towards constructing a seismic gap and additional rigid diaphragm at the base of the building. A column-top isolation system, in which isolators are placed directly at the column tops, below the floor diaphragm, has been suggested to mitigate some of the costs associated with isolation retrofit. This study considers the behaviour of a column-top isolation system using elastomeric bearings, accounting for rotational effects at the isolator-column interface and the P-Δ effects due to large isolation layer displacements. A steel moment frame was designed using historic code provisions and retrofitted with column-top isolation. Nonlinear time history analyses of the pre-retrofit and retrofit buildings were conducted under multiple current hazard levels to assess the performance and validity of the retrofit scheme.","tags":[],"title":"Preliminary Study on the Behaviour of a Column-Top Isolation System","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://AdrianCrowder.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
